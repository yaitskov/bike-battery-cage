# Theft resistant battery cage for bikes

I've rebuilt my typical city bike into electrical one using a rear motor-wheel.
No big deal these days.


The motor is mounted relatively safe. 
It is locked automatically with a wheel when you parking, but
the battery is just a blue baggage box. 
It is not fixed/secured anyhow, nonetheless it costs more than bike and motor-wheel together.

That is not good.

Here I present a simple model in FreeCad (0.16) which could be built out of single type of steel stripes.
Stripe thinckens and width are parameterized. 

The idea is just lock battery in a cage and fix the cage to the bike frame at the same time.
I am thinking combining parts with epoxy glue or welding.
